Are you preparing for the Azure Solutions Architect AZ-305 examination? In this course, instructor Nicole Stevens helps you master the skills and knowledge you need to pass the exam domain focused on designing data storage solutions.  Nicole goes over data storage in Azure, then dives into what you need to know to make effective recommendations on data storage solutions. She steps you through designing for unstructured data in Azure and deep dives into everything you need to know about designing for structured relational data and semistructured data in Azure. Nicole covers design considerations for data integration, orchestration, warehousing, and more. Plus, she points you toward additional learning resources on Azure data storage, including tutorials and documentation.

## Instructions
This repository does not have any branches. Download the entire repository and you get the demo environments and other setups to look at, all in their final state.

Each folder top level folder corresponds to a chapter, then a folder underneath to a video with files specific to that video. The naming convention is CHAPTER#_MOVIE#. As an example, the folder named 02_03 corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter.

Within each folder is a chapterX.md file, this contains the commands to be run in the cloudshell to create each environment. The environments allow you to follow along with the videos.

## Installing
These files are designed to be run in Azure Cloudshell. You do not require anything installed locally to use these files.  However, if you would like to study the files locally I recommend the following:

1. Install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2. Add the following extensions to VS Code:
   - [Azure Bicep Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-bicep)
   - [Azure CLI Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.azurecli)

To use the files in Azure Cloudshell, clone the repository within the cloudshell, CD to the appropriate directory for your video and execute the commands from the chapterX.md file at the cloudshell command line. For help with Cloudshell, checkout the [quickstart](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-shell/quickstart)
